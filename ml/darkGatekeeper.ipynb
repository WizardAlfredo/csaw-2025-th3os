    "turned the side-channel search into an unsupervised anomaly-detection problem. For each password position, I first collected a batch of traces from random (almost certainly wrong) guesses and used them to learn what “normal = wrong guess” looks like: standardize the traces, reduce dimensionality with PCA, then fit a One-Class SVM on the resulting components. With that background model in place, I tested every candidate character and scored its trace with the SVM’s decision function—more negative means “more anomalous” relative to the wrong-guess distribution. The character whose trace was most anomalous was chosen as the correct one, then the process repeated for the next position. This replaces a brittle single correlation threshold with a noise-tolerant, data-driven detector."
